        <h1>HTML Boilerplate Metadata</h1>
        This page takes a closer look at the metadata section of HTML Boilerplate.  See what tags are available and how you can use them to make your website more popular.  
            <br><br>
        Metadata has some attributes, they are: charset, http-equiv, name, content, and all global attributes found here- https://www.w3schools.com/tags/ref_standardattributes.asp
            <br><br>
        In this webpage the metadata is all within individual meta tags, however you could instead use semicolons and list them one after another in a single meta tag string.
