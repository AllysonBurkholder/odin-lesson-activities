    <h1>This document looks at some simple text options with HTML.  This was written within "h1" tag.  </h1>
    <p>Make a paragraph using the "p" tag.  You can later name and style your paragraphs so they could be useful instead of having text floating around. This was written within the paragraph, p, tag.  </p>
    <h3>there are a lot of headings to use in HTML as well, they aren't too exciting on their own but you can fancy them up with some styling.  The webpage looks at headings to help determine importance.  h1 is the biggest heading, and it most important. This was written in h3.  </h3>
    <p>In another paragaph here to explore some other options.  There's fancy texts too like <b>the classic bold, "b"</b> or <strong>"strong" text which is important like headings</strong> and also <i>lighter with italics</i> using the "i" tag, and <em>dramatic with emphasis</em> with the shorthand "em".  </i></b></p>
    <br><br>
    <p>there are other texts too, like <mark>this one to "mark" or hilight</mark>, and this one that <small>makes the text "small"</small>.  Deleted text, "del" is the same as a <del>markthrough</del> which you might use to show revisions or checklist.  In addition to deleted text you can <ins>insert text which underlines it</ins> to show what's new.</p>
    <p>Other text mods are included too! you can <sub>subscript</sub> or <sup>superscript</sup> text which as you can see moves it <sup>up</sup> or <sub>down</sub> a bit.  </p>
    All these working together plus additional styling can make for some interesting outcomes.  Experiment like I did on this webpage to discover new things.
